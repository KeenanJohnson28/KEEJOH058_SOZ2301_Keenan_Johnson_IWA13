// Hereâ€™s what I changed:

// In the logCalc function, I fixed the syntax error by changing const = logCalc () => { to const logCalc = () => {. 
//I also fixed the logic error by changing calculated === calculatedAsNumber + 1 to calculated = calculatedAsNumber + 1.

// In the calcUser function, I added a call to logCalc to increment the calculated variable. 
//I also added two conditions to update the state variable based on the value of calculated.

// In the checkUser function, I added a condition to check if calculated is equal to 3 before logging the message to the console. This ensures that the message is only
